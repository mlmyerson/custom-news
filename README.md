# Custom News

React + TypeScript static site scaffolded with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/). The `dist/` folder generated by the build step can be deployed to any static host (Netlify, GitHub Pages, Cloudflare Pages, S3, etc.).

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm (or a compatible package manager).

## Setup

```bash
npm install
```

## Development

```bash
npm run dev    # start Vite dev server with hot reloading
```

## Production build

```bash
npm run build  # output static assets to dist/
```

Preview the production build locally:

```bash
npm run preview
```

Deploy the contents of `dist/` to your preferred static hosting platform.

## GitHub Pages deployment

This repo ships with a workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) that builds the site with Node 20 and publishes the
`dist/` folder to GitHub Pages. Once the workflow is enabled in the repository settings (`Settings → Pages → Build and
deployment → GitHub Actions`), every push to `main` will:

1. Install dependencies with `npm ci`.
2. Run `npm run build`.
3. Upload the `dist/` artifact and deploy it via `actions/deploy-pages`.

Because the project lives at `https://<username>.github.io/custom-news/`, the Vite config sets `base: '/custom-news/'`
so the generated asset paths resolve correctly in production. Update that base path if you fork the repo under a
different name.
