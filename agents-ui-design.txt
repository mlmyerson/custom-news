AGENT DESIGN BRIEF — Morning Issue Radar
=======================================

Purpose
-------
Translate the headline-to-keyword experience into a calm, trustworthy interface that foregrounds the "issue radar" story.
Address readability and cohesion issues observed in the current build while leaving room for future Topic and Article views.

Guiding Principles
------------------
1. **One story above the fold.** Every element on the landing screen should reinforce that we're surfacing cross-source
   issue signals for the day. Remove scaffolding copy that speaks to implementation steps.
2. **Let hierarchy do the explaining.** Use deliberate type scales, spacing, and contrast to organize information instead of
   duplicative text or decorative containers.
3. **Focus on the keywords.** Bubbles exist to communicate phrases + weight. Secondary metadata (sources, quotes) should
   appear contextually, not inside the bubble body text.
4. **Calm color, clear contrast.** Prefer a curated palette with guaranteed WCAG contrast; avoid random gradients that create
   legibility issues.
5. **Responsive by intent.** Layout decisions (grid, side panels) must degrade gracefully on small screens without resorting to
   separate "mobile" designs.

Pain Points to Avoid
--------------------
- Developer-facing copy (“Step 1 scaffolds…”) that dilutes the user value proposition.
- Bubbles overloaded with labels, uppercase metrics, tiny source lines, and quotes.
- Randomly generated gradients that may pair light backgrounds with low-contrast text.
- Nested card-on-card frames and heavy shadows that create visual noise.
- Nearly uniform bubble sizes that fail to signal weight differences.

Prescribed Design Direction
---------------------------
### 1. Hero + Context
- Replace the current hero paragraph with: “See which stories every major outlet repeats today. We cluster Guardian,
  NYT, NPR, and Reuters headlines into issue phrases so you can scan the landscape at a glance.”
- Add a sub-row under the hero heading showing the last refresh timestamp (“Updated 12:42 PM • 48 headlines • 4 sources”).
- Keep the Branch Indicator but tone down its styling to a pill that tucks under the header on desktop and floats at the
  bottom on mobile.

### 2. Bubble Canvas
- Expand bubble diameters to a wider range (140–260 px). Use a quantized scale (e.g., XS/S/M/L/XL) derived from mention
  counts to avoid micro-variations that feel arbitrary.
- Limit bubble content to **phrase + mention badge**. Example: phrase in Title Case, mention badge in a small capsule
  (“12 mentions”). Remove in-bubble source/date and quotes.
- On hover/focus, reveal a tooltip or side panel with:
  - Sample headline quote and source/date
  - "Explore" button that navigates to Topic View
- Allow bubbles to overlap slightly within the grid to create an organic field. Ensure semantic order remains logical for
  screen readers.

### 3. Supporting Panel
- Introduce a right-hand (or collapsible) panel titled “Pulse Details” listing the top 5 phrases with trend bars and source
  counts. This grounds the visualization in textual data for users who prefer lists.
- Reserve room in this panel for future summary bullets (Step 7) so the layout remains stable.

### 4. Typography & Spacing
- Establish a scale such as: Eyebrow 0.8rem uppercase tracking, H1 2.5rem/130%, H2 1.4rem/140%, body 1rem/160%, caption
  0.85rem/140%.
- Use a single sans-serif family with weight variations (400/600/700) to keep the voice consistent.
- Increase vertical spacing between sections (3–4rem) and reduce inner card padding; ideally the bubble canvas sits on a
  subtle tinted surface with a single 8px radius.

### 5. Color System
- Background: soft gray-violet (#f4f5fb) gradient top-to-bottom for depth.
- Cards/panels: pure white with 1px border and faint shadow.
- Bubbles: choose ~6 hues (magenta, violet, teal, blue, amber, green). For each hue, define two tokens: light background
  (L* > 90) and dark text (#1f2430). Assign hue by mention bracket (e.g., 0–5 teal, 6–10 violet, etc.).
- Mention badge: neutral slate text on translucent white, so it reads regardless of bubble color.

### 6. Interaction & Feedback
- Keep the “Refresh sources” button but add a small spinner inside the button when loading and change copy to “Refreshing…”.
- Display inline alerts only when a source fails; otherwise rely on the timestamp to show data freshness.
- On mobile, convert the bubble grid into a vertically scrolling, two-column layout with a sticky summary panel below the
  hero.

Implementation Notes
--------------------
- Gradually migrate bubble rendering to accept a `variant` prop (e.g., `compact`, `interactive`) so the simplified content
  can ship independently of the hover tooltips.
- Extract color assignments into a `getBubbleTheme(weight: number)` helper for predictable palettes and contrast checks.
- Update `App.css` copy and spacing before touching the component tree to keep the change set manageable.
- Reuse the supporting panel in Topic View later to maintain visual continuity between states.

Next Steps
----------
1. Update hero copy + metadata row.
2. Simplify bubble markup and add tooltip pattern.
3. Introduce the supporting panel and responsive behavior.
4. Refine color tokens + typography scale in `App.css` / `BubbleView.css`.
5. Revisit Topic View to ensure the redesign language carries through once article search ships.
